Hello, everyone

my name is melody and i'm the menu innovation marketing manager at McDonald's USA
==============================
today I'm here to introduce you to the taste of the world campaign that will debut in the state of oregon
and to also talk about the three menu items that the marketing team recommends for this campaign
==============================
recent studies show american's increasing interest in ethnic foods.  to capitlize on these findings. mcdonald's decided to initiate the taste of the world campaign.  

the purpose of this campaign is to market menu items from mcdonald's international menus to americans' who have interests in ethnic foods

this campaign will first debut in oregon. depending on its sucess, McDonald's will decide whether to expand this campaign into a national venture.

therefore, the marketing team was tasked with analyzing the aspects of oregon (seeing what is grown there and the taste prferences of oregonians) and to also give three recommended menu items from mcdonald's international menus that best caters to oregonians

so, with this covered, let's move onto the findings
===============================
here is a map of what is grown in oregon.  

Oregon is located on the west coast of the united states.  its climate allows for more than 250 different products to be grown

so the state's beverage is milk.  and so reflecting that there's a lot of cow icons dotted all over the state.  so this also means that there's many creameries. some of the famous ones include rogue creamery and the tillamook county creamery association

besides this, oregon is the nation's number one producer of blackberries, peppermint...and christmas trees.  

however, moving onto the coast we can also see some shrimp, crab, and fish icons.  oregon is one of the world's top harvesters of the dungedness crab.  as for shrimp, in 2012, the state harvested 49.1 million pounds of pink shrimp 
==============================
and moving on. 

the marketing team gave out a questionnaire to 200,000 oregonians gauging their eating habits and opinion on mcdonald's.

we found out that while most oregonians ate meat, at least 24 percent of them were vegetarians

69 percent of them expressed interest towards the possibility of ethnic food choices being added to their mcdonald's menus.

along those lines, that they also expressed an interest in either a new breakfast, lunch or dinner, or snack option 

here is a table on the results from one of the questions.  it asks for participants to pick the most appealing cuisine to them. the top four results were chinese, mexican, italian, and japaense
==============================
based on these findings, we came up with a list of criteria

based on the survey we decided that the campaign should feature one breakfst, one lunch/dinner, and one appetizer to market to customers that visit mcdonald's at different times.

we also decided to focus on finding japanese, mexican, italian menu items. recent studies show that many citizens find that mexican, italian, and chinese food to be typical, while japanese is considered to them to be more exotic. so we wanted to give our customers a way to try a more exotic option like japanese food while still being able to fall back on more known cuisines like italian and mexican.

finally we decided to find menu items which incoroporated local ingredients such cheese or shrimp.

and so based on this we found the following three menu items
=============================
first up is the mcdonald's mexico's mcmolletes 

so this is a breakfast option

what it basically involves is sliced tomatoes ontop of a piece of cheese which is placed ontop of some refried beans then you place that all ontop of a piece of hard bread.

the marketing team also recommends to market that cheese is optional. in removing the cheese from this item, the mcmolletes could become a vegetarian option that can cater to the vegetarians in oregon.  however, this will also require that the refried beans be made with vegetable oil instead of lard

============================
the second menu item is the spianch and parmesan cheese nuggets frm mcdonald's italy.

the name actually does speaks for itself and it is primarily made of paremsan cheese and spinach

as a snack option, these nuggets will also provide mcdonald's with an opportunity to work closely with Oregon's creameries like Rogue Creamery to localize this menu item.
============================
the third and final recommendation is mcdonald's japan's 

gurako burger burger.

the name gurako comes from two english-equse japanese words: gratin and croquet. combine the two nd you get gurako.

so the gurako burger also kind of speaks for itself (if you know the language).  this croquet burger like gratin is very creamy. inside the patty you have potatoes and shrimp.

all of the ingredients can be easily provided and fresh by oregon's producers and harvesters.  
==============================
so, the purpose of this campaign is market our internationl menu items to  americans, who show interest in ethnic foods
Mcdonald's has chosen oregon as its first milestone.
this means the success of the campaign in oregon will decide whether this new promotion will live to expand to a national venture

the marketing team realizes this and trusts that name name name are menu items that best caters to oregonians.

My team and I sincerely trusts in the success of this campaign and that together we'll keep our current customers while bringing in many more 

thank you.
