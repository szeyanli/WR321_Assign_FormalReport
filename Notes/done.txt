	-careful considerations or potential risks
		-not absolute claim
		-may not be accurate foods
		-not involve health, current items, or current sales 
		-(explain how risks can be minimized) based on these choices
		-no analysis of health reasons
		-no analysis of current menu items
		-no analysis of current mcdonald's sales at oregon
		-allergies and vegetarians
	-market quality and the fact we're using local foods
	-vegetarian options hard to gauge. in general they want to eat healthy, currently hard step for mcdonald's.
	
	
	-was a pick between 3 (salmon, ebi, or crab)
		-crab too high cost
		-salmon with issue in netherlands. people might be skeptical still (since this is a new program)
		-so shrimp with it's successes overseas proves good
	-11 percent hispanic
		-mexican molettes
	-dairy products
		-cheese product
		
		-avg age shows no need to cater for old or young. just normal standard foods. no preference so free reign. thinking of two main and one snack
		-this will give variety
		
			(novelty, won't mind something new)
	(if successful overseas, no reason why it can't be successful over here?)
	(based on ethnicity, tie it in with annual holiday)
	
	-weight of decision is based on primary research, while secondary research will be used to support or disaprove the decision
	
	-on risks is this. it's not good to assume that a person who likes japanese cuisine likes all aspects of japanese cuisine.  this is one thing to note.  however, within the international menus, these are the food choices that best caters to their prference for a certain cuisine.  these choices are to increase receptiveness of oregonians, not to make asbolute claims that they'll absolute like it.
	-also these selections are from the mcondonald's of a certain country but they cannot be considered true "x" country cuisine.  they're simply featured in that country and may not be authentic are even actually the country's foods
	
	-focusing on recommendations:
	-establish need for action in intro by describing problem or opportunity
	-introduce benefits or potential risks
	-list steps recommendations required to achieve the benefit
	-explain each step more carefully, giving details on procedures, costs, and benefits (explain how risks can be minimized)
	-summarize recommendations

	-scope
	-no analysis of health reasons
	-no analysis of current menu items
	-no analysis of current mcdonald's sales at oregon
	-allergies and vegetarians
	-no cost analysis? projected cost 
	
Conclusions and Recommendations
	-overview of study of oregon, what it showed
	-three recommendations
	-including local produce. how to market?
