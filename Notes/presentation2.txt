Hello, everyone

my name is melody and i'm the menu innovation marketing manager at McDonald's USA

==============================

today I'm here to introduce you to the taste of the world campaign that will debut in the state of oregon
and to also talk about the three menu items that the marketing team recommends for this campaign

==============================
mcdonald's owns the world's largest fast food chain in the world. 

we have over 34,000 restaurants worldwide with over 1.8 million employees.

and the key to our success has always been through adaptation and innovation.  

==============================
recent studies show american's increasing interest in ethnic foods.  to capitlize on these findings. mcdonald's decided to initiate the taste of the world campaign.  

the purpose of this campaign is to introduce menu items from mcdonald's international menus and market them to the nation's increasing interest in ethnic foods.  

this campaign will first debut in oregon. depending on its sucess, McDonald's will decide whether to expand this campaign into a national venture.

therefore, the marketing team was tasked with analyzing the aspects of oregon (seeing what is grown there and the taste prferences of oregonians) and to also give three recommended menu items from mcdonald's international menus that best caters to oregonians

so now that we've covered the objective, let's move onto the findings
===============================
here is a physical map of oregon.  the cascade range splits the state into two diverse climates. on the west we have higher precipitation than the east. not only that. these two diverse climates also splits the state into 6 or 7 major growing regions

this allows for more than 250 different products to be grown in oregon

===============================
here is a map of what is grown in oregon.

so the state's beverage is milk.  and so reflecting that there's a lot of cow icons all over the state.  so there's many creameries in the state some of which are Rogue Creamery or the Tillamook County Creamery Association.  

besides this, oregon is the nation's number one producer of blackberries, peppermint...and christmas trees.  

however, moving onto the coast we can also see some shrimp, crab, and fish icons.  oregon is one of the world's top harvesters of the dungedness crab.  as for shrimp, in 2012, the state harvested 49.1 million pounds of shrimp 
==============================
and moving on. 

the marketing team gave out a questionnaire to 200,000 oregonians gauging their eating habits and opinion on mcdonald's.

we found out that while most oregonians ate meat, at least 24 percent of them were vegetarians

69 percent of them responded favorably towards the possibility of ethnic food choices being added to their mcdonald's menus.

and that they would like to see either a new breakfast, lunch or dinner, or snack option 

here is a table on the results from one of the questions.  it asks for participants to list the most appealing cuisine to them. the top four results were chinese, mexican, italian, and japaense
==============================
based on these findings, we came up with a list of criteria

based on the survey we decided that the campaign should feature one breakfst, one lunch/dinner, and one appetizer to market to customers that visit mcdonald's at different times.

we also decided to focus on finding japanese, mexican, italian menu items. recent studies show that many citizens find that mexican, italian, and chinese were considered typical options, while japanese is considered more exotic. so we wanted to give our customers a way to try a more exotic option like japanese while still being able to fall back on more known cuisines like italian and mexican.

finally we decided to find menu items which incoroporated cheese or shrimp as ingredients.

and so based on this we found the following three menu items
=============================
first up is the mcdonald's mexico's mcmolletes 

so this is a breakfast option

what it basically involves is sliced tomatoes ontop of a piece of cheese which is placed ontop of some refried beans then you place that all ontop of a piece of hard bread.

the marketing team also recommends to market that cheese is optional.  this will show that mcdonald's recognizes the vegetarians in oregon in providing a vegetarian option.  however, this will also require that the refried beans be made without the use of lard.

============================
the second menu item is the spianch and parmesan cheese nuggets frm mcdonald's italy.

the name actually speaks for itself but its actual name is... something i can't really pronounce... Crocchette di Spinaci Parmigiano Reggiano

as a snack option, these nuggets will also provide mcdonald's with an opportunity to work closely with Oregon's creameries like Rogue Creamery to localize this menu item.
============================
the third and final recommendation is mcdonald's japan's 

gurako burger burger.

the name gurako comes from two romanized japanese words gratin and croquet. combine the two nd you get gurako.

so the gurako burger also kind of speaks for itself (if you know the language).  this croquet burger is very creamy. inside the patty you have potatoes and shrimp.

all of the ingredients can be easily provided and fresh by oregon's producers and harvesters.  
==============================
so, the purpose of this campaign is market our internationl menu items to american's increasingi interest in ethnic foods.  
Mcdonald's has chosen oregon as its first milestone.
this means the success of the campaign in oregon will decide whether this new promotion will live to expand to a national venture

the marketing team realizes this and trusts that name name name are menu items that best caters to oregonians.

My team and I sincerely trusts in the success of this campaign and that together we'll keep our current customers while bringing many more in

thank you.
