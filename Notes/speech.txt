Hello, everyone

my name is melody and i'm the menu innovation marketing manager at McDonald's USA
today I'm here to introduce you to the taste of the world campaign that will debut in the state of oregon
and to also talk about the three menu items that the marketing team recommends for this campaign
these menu items are actually displayed behind me and the left it's: name, name name
==============================

So first, I'll introduce you to the campaign. 
then we'll talk about what is grown in oregon and the taste preferences of oregonians
finally, we'll move onto the three menu items that the marketing trusts will best cater to Oregonians

==============================

so...If i were to leave this room right now, I could easily find a pedestrian who's heard of mcdonald's

mcdonald's owns the world's largest fast food chain in the world. 

we have over 34,000 restaurants worldwide with over 1.8 million employees.

and the key to our success has always been through innovation.  

==============================

in 2008, mcdonald's italian franchises worked together with the local farmers to bring the country's famous parmigiaano regianno cheese to the McDonald's burgers.  

and the results were great. that year sales rose 15 percent.  

so the question is. why not do that here?  why not market to America's diverse ethnicities and cultures and bring in international menu items that caters to our diverse citizens?  

==============================
this leads us to the motivation for the taste of the world campaign.  

the purpose of this campaign is to bring in menu items from mcdonald's international menus to America.  

McDonald's decided that the campaign will first debut in oregon. depending on its sucess in oregon, McDonald's will gauge whether to expand this campaign into a national venture.

therefore, the vice president of operations, corbett upton, has tasked the marketing team with analyzing the aspects of oregon (seeing what is grown there and the taste prferences of oregonians) and to also give three recommended menu items from mcdonald's international menus that best caters to oregonians

so now that we've covered the objective, let's move onto the findings
===============================
here is a physical map of oregon.  the cascade ranges splits the state into two diverse climates. on the west we have higher precipitation than the east. not only that. these two diverse climates also splits the state into 6 or 7 major growing regions

this allows for more than 250 different products to be grown in oregon

===============================
here is a map of what is grown in oregon.

so the state's beverage is milk.  and so you can see there's a lot of cow icons all over the state.  so there's many creameries in the state some of which are Rogue Creamery or Tillamook County Creamery Association.  

(actually, One of the state’s famous products is Rogue Creamery’s Oregon Blue cheese, which won the London World Cheese Award, which also makes it the first American cheese to ever win the award)

besides this, oregon is the nation's number one producer of (), peppermint...and christmas trees.  

however, moving onto the coast we can also see some shrimp, crab, and fish icons.  oregon is one of the world's top harvesters of the dungedness crab.  as for shrimp, in 2012, the state harvested 49.1 million pounds of shrimp which contributed to 24 million dollars to the state's economy.
==============================
moving on. 

the marketing team gave out a questionnaire to 200,000 oregonians gauging their eating habits and opinion on mcdonald's.

we found out that most oregonians eat white meats, red meats, and seafood.

however, at least 24 percent of the participants stated they were vegetarians.

moving on to more mcdonald's related topics, 69 percent of them responded favorably towards the possibility of ethnic food choices being added to their mcdonald's menus.

and that they would like to see either a new breakfast, lunch or dinner, or snack option 

here is a table on the results from one of the questions.  it asks for participants to list the most appealing cuisine to them. the top four results were chinese, mexican, italian, and japaense
==============================
based on the survey and what we found to be grown in oregon, we came up with al ist of criteria

based on the survey we wanted mealoptions which were for breakfast, lunch or dinner, or as an appeitizer. we decided that the campaign should feature one of each and market to customers that visit mcdonald's at different times.

we also decided to focus on finding japanese, mexican, italian options. we decided that chinese and japanese were both asian cuisines and decided to pick japanese instead.  recent studies also show that many citizens find that mexican, italian, and chinese were considered typical options, while japanese is considered more exotic. so we wanted to give our customers a way to try a more exotic option like japanese while still being able to fall back on more known cuisines like italian and mexican.

finally since there was no interest in desert from the survey results, we decided to find menu items which incoroporated cheese or shrimp as ingredients.

and so based on this we found the following three menu items
=============================
first up is the mcdonald's mexico's mcmolletes 

so this is a breakfast option

what it basically involves is sliced tomatoes ontop of a piece of cheese which is placed ontop of some refried beans then you place that all ontop of a piece of hard bread.

the marketing team also recommends to market that cheese is optional.  this will show that mcdonald's recognizes the vegetarians in oregon in providing a vegetarian option.  however, this will also require that the refried beans be made without the use of lard.

============================
the second menu item is the spianch and parmesan cheese nuggets frm mcdonald's italy.

it may look green but it's actually pretty good.  the name actually speaks for itself but its actual name is... something i can't really pronounce... Crocchette di Spinaci Parmigiano Reggiano

as a snack option, these nuggets will also provide mcdonald's with an opportunity to work closely with Oregon's creameries like Rogue Creamery to localize this menu item.
============================
the third and final recommendation is mcdonald's japan's 

gurako burger or korokke burger.

the name gurako comes from two romanized japanese words guratin for gratin and kurokke for croquet. combine the two nd you get gurako.

so the gurako burger also kind of speaks for itself (if you know the language).  this croquet burger is very creamy. inside the patty you have potatoes and shrimp.

all of the ingredients can be easily provided and fresh by oregon's producers and harvesters.  
==============================
so, the purpose of this campaign is to reach out to more customers by marketing to America's diversity.  
Mcdonald's has chosen oregon as its first milestone.
this means the success of the campaign in oregon will decide whether this new promotion will live to expand to a national venture

the marketing team realizes this and trusts that name name name are menu items that best caters to oregonians.

My team and I sincerely trusts in the success of this campaign and that together we'll keep our current customers while bringing many more in

thank you.
