Purpose of the “Taste of the World” Campaign
McDonald’s Corporation owns the world’s largest chain of fast-food restaurants, with more than 34,000 restaurants worldwide.  Among the reasons this chain is so successful is its adaptability in various countries, providing innovative menu items that fit the taste buds of the local community.  

In the United States of America, McDonald’s focus has been on improving its food quality, rather than the innovation of new menu items.  However, recent studies show Americans’ increasing interest and receptiveness towards ethnic foods.  To capitalize on these findings, McDonald’s sought a new direction that will boost its sales in the United States by marketing to the country’s diverse cultures and ethnicities.  To this end, McDonald’s decided to initiate a new “Taste of the World” campaign, using the state of Oregon as its first experimental ground.
