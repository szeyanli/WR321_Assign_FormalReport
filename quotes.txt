		-success
		-consistency, innovation, resiliency
		-"It doesn't matter if you're visiting a McDonald's in California or Connecticut, America or Australia – you're going to have a similar experience wherever you are. "
		-"At first, the characteristics of consistency and innovation seem to contradict one another. But in fact, they work together to allow for McDonald's continued growth. Staying consistent on the core components of your business doesn't mean the products you sell, McDonald's Menu Site-1or even the way you deliver them, have to stay the same. It's a delicate balance. "
		-"For decades, McDonald's has had many lawsuits directed at them for various issues, and has been the subject of a large amount of negative press. What does McDonald's do combat this negativity? It appears part of their strategy entails acknowledging the concern, and then dedicating resources in-house to staying on top of the issue

How mcdonald's addresses issues
==============================

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_availability_of_McDonald's_products
		In order to cater to local tastes and culinary traditions, and often in respect of particular laws or religious beliefs, McDonald's offers regionalized versions of its menu among and within different countries. As a result, products found in one country or region may not be found in McDonald's restaurants in other countries.

			-focus on quality
			-“Many consumers today are actually willing to pay a little bit more for what they perceive to be a better meal.”
			-It’s fighting for it, with new offerings like the Cheddar Bacon Onion sandwich. The ingredients are loaded with premium adjectives: the bacon is hickory-smoked, onions caramelized. There’s even a loungy, vibraphone-heavy theme song for the burger on the McDonald’s website. The fast food chain hopes its marketing push is enough to entice diners to move beyond the value menu and pay the new sandwich’s suggested retail price of $4.39.
	
	http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/business/mcdonalds-moves-toward-a-healthier-menu.html?_r=1&
		-Under pressure to provide healthier meals, McDonald’s announced on Thursday that it would no longer market some of its less nutritional options to children and said it also planned to include offerings of fruits and vegetables in many of its adult menu combinations.

============================================================

	http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Suppliers2/Americans-taste-preferences-becoming-more-exotic-says-Mintel
		-Americans are expanding their taste for ethnic cuisines, as some flavors that were once considered exotic have entered the mainstream, according to market research organization Mintel.

OREGON & McDonalds
============================================================

	http://www.bendbugle.com/2005/10/mcdonalds-and-other-fast-food-good-news-for-oregon-producers/
		-using local goods also benefits agricultural producers. symbiotic relationship
		-we get fresh ingredients, they get profit and reputation for selling to us
		-we use local goods and build a sense of community
		-"From the locally-grown
	onions and cucumbers that end up on hamburgers to the potatoes used for French fries, McDonald’s and others have developed a relationship with Pacific Northwest growers that seems to be working for both parties."
		-"The numbers back up the claim. In the past year, McDonald’s local produce purchased from Oregon includes more than 320 million pounds of
	potatoes, 1.5 million pounds of onions, and almost 5 million pounds of cucumbers that are processed into pickles. "
		-“Much of our agriculture would not look the same if it wasn’t for food service operators like McDonald’s and others who source large amounts of Oregon product,” says Hobbs. 
		-“Just because there seems to be a McDonald’s on every other street corner in America doesn’t mean their food comes from a large, faraway factory,” says Levy. “At least for those restaurants in the Pacific Northwest, much of the menu can be traced back to the local producers who contribute to Oregon’s agricultural economy. That also means
	fresh, good tasting food for the consumer.”
		-so this means we already do this. 
		-Other menu items at the golden arches have direct ties to Oregon. Thanks to its Tillamook Cheddar Big n’ Tasty burger and its dessert
	offerings, McDonald’s this year has purchased 1,180 cases of cheese and nearly 30,000 three-gallon tubs of ice cream from the Tillamook County Creamery Association. 
		-“It’s no accident that companies like McDonald’s look to Oregon because we are able to consistently produce a high quality product,” says Hobbs. “We feel that as menus change or perhaps even stay the same, Oregon’s reputation for quality will continue to play an important role in the future.”
		-McDonald’s shopping list includes ingredients for a new, health-oriented menu. Last summer, McDonald’s started offering apple slices with a caramel dipping sauce. That was followed up with a new fruit salad. Up to 54 million pounds of apples are used each year to fulfill the needs of the new menu. While many of the apples are grown in the State of Washington, Oregon growers also benefit from McDonald’s new tastes.
		
		-so already we use oregon produce.
		-form good relationship. local commodities + build sense of relationship + fresh foods
		-from healthy choices to any choices.

INTERNATIONAL SUCCESSES
=================================
	
	http://money.cnn.com/2009/07/10/news/companies/mcdonalds_global_international_menu.fortune/
		-McDonald's has courted international consumers with customized approaches, from supporting local farmers and suppliers to creating elaborate guerilla marketing campaigns.
		-In Italy, it was a question of targeting native palates directly with the Parmigiano Reggiano. Launched in September 2008 and now called the "Parma Reg" by regulars, the beef burger features Italy's popular Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, as well as other key regional ingredients. That, along with attempts to enlist the backing of Italian farmers, has made McDonald's -- in Italy, at least -- feel like a homegrown brand. (this goes with benefit of community)
