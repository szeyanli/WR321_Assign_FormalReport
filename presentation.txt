============

Hello, everyone.
My name is Melody and I'm the Menu Innovation Marketing Manager at McDonald's
Today, I am very excited to present to you my recommendations for the Taste of the World campaign in Oregon, USA
----
So first off, we'll begin with an introduction to the campaign.  
This will lead us to our next topic, which is "what is oregon?" what is the state famous for? what is grown in oregon? most importantly, what are the taste preferences of oregonians
lastly, i'll talk about the recommended menu items that should be featured in this new campaign
-------
currently, mcdonald's owns the world's largest chain of fast-food restaurants

but how doe we maintain our success?

-through innovation!

For the past years, my team and I have been conducting studies to improve sales at the US.
